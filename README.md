# Anathema, a to-be-renamed scifi roguelike

### Rough Goals
What do we want?
    * Techno-Barbarians
    * Weird psionics
    * Emergent behaviour / interactions

How are we implementing them?
    * F#
    * Purely immutable game-state
    * If possible, purely data state (so that "saving" becomes JSON serialize)
    * Some mechanism to define things via text files that are loaded at runtime?
    * A completely type-safe ECS?
